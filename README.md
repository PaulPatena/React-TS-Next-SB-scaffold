This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Storybook, Typescript, Jest are all configured.

## Requirements
This project was run using node version 18.14.2, ideally newer 
versions should also work.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm run storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the main app.

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the storybook.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To use storybook, you can follow the example in `stories/Product.stories.tsx`
